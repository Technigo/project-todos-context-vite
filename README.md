# Todo - useContext Project

Creating a todo App using React Context.

## The Problem

I used Figjam and Figma to plan for the project. I used Figjam to make a plan for which components I needed and what they would take care of and Figma for planning the design. If I had more time I would add more functionalities to the app for example a dark and light mode.
