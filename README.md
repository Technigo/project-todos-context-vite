# Todo App Project

This project is built with React, Vite, and leveraging global state management using the `useContext` hook. It's designed to provide a simple yet powerful way to create, delete and update tasks.


## The Problem

A challenge encountered was devising a cohesive logic for the "Check All" and "Uncheck All" functionality, ensuring that all tasks could be efficiently toggled between completed and incomplete states.
