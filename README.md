# Todo - useContext Project

The assignment was to build a todo app using Context API.

### The Problem

As always I started with the jsx code, and breaking down each feature into components. This time I broke it down to even smaller bits (down to the task on the list). The components need to be able to add todos, remove todos, and set them to done or not done. So I made those three things into functions provided by the context. I had in mind the iPhone todo list as a reference.
