# Todo - useContext Project

In this project we had to create a todo application where the user can add and remove tasks, mark them as completed and change them back to uncompleted.

### The Problem

We solved the problem by laying out the foundation and discussing what components we needed. Then we used useContext hook to complete the project. If we had more time we would do light and dark theme.
